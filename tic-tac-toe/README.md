# tic-tac-toe
The game is a replacement for the game I made when I was 15. It has somewhat better code, but it's still a mess. The mess makes it an accurat re-make of the original game. This was smacked toghteher without much in planning, so it's not firendly code

I want to build on this and maybe create a more realistic AI for it, (or less AI and more pattern-analysis).
